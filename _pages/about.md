I'm Armin, the R & D manager of Knowledge Enterprise Company of LPA in Iran. I have a massive passion for challenges and problems that are in the domain of multi-disciplinary fields. I have faced multiple obstacles during my academic and professional years, which were solved through critical thinking, breaking down the problems to a manageable size, vigor, and persistence. In addition to these merits, I have good communicative relations, which are invaluable for team goals.

My work and research
======
Currently, I work in a knowledge enterprise company that dedicates its workforce to two branches (a) consulting and research for government entities and (b) the manufacturing of various nano-concrete products such as manhole covers and frames (according to BS-EN124 code), line markers, truss profiles, and more. At first, I started as a researcher and then participated in a few studies with the primary purpose of understanding the root of the problem and providing a systematic approach to solving it. Projects that I contributed to are as follows:
(1) "Investigating the risk of land subsidence of plains in Zanjan and Qazvin provinces on high voltage transmission lines using satellite imagery and spatial information systems and offer corrective solutions" for Zanjan Regional Electric Company.
(2) "Methods to remove roots and prevent root intrusion in branch connections of sewage and water pipes" for Water and Sewage Company of Mashhad.
(3) "Seismic Vulnerability Assessment (Case Study) and Risk Evaluation of Electrical Substations" for Azerbaijan Regional Electricity Company.
(4) "Investigating the feasibility of reactive powder concrete in manhole cover manufacturing" for the Water and Sewage Company of Eastern Azarbaijan.
After a year, I was promoted to R & D manager, where I handled the following:
(a) Design and rendering of new products.
(b) Performing finite element analysis (FEM) to optimize product properties.
(c) Testing a new combination of materials to accomplish the best quality material.
(d) Enhancing the manufacturing process by designing tools necessary to increase productivity.

My background and history
======
I received my bachelor's degree from Urmia University, majoring in civil engineering, and my master's degree from the University of Tabriz, majoring in water resources engineering. My research experience started during my master's degree in conducting my thesis with the consultation of distinguished professor Vahid Nourani about "Spatio-temporal Disaggregation of Rainfall using Rain-gauge and Radar Derived Data." The central hypothesis of my thesis was the scale-invariant nature of rainfall in the temporal and spatial domain, which was investigated via wavelet transform, soft computing techniques, and stochastic processes.
