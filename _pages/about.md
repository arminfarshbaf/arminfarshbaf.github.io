I'm Armin, the R & D manager of Knowledge Enterprise Company of LPA in Iran. I have a huge passion for challenges and problems that are in the domain of multi-disciplinary fields. I have faced multiple obstacles during my academic and professional years which were solved through critical thinking, breaking down the problems to a managable size, vigour and persistence. In addition to these merits I have good communicative relations which is invaluable for team goals.


My work and research
======
Currently, I work in a knowledge enterprise company which dedicates its manpower to two branches of consulting and research for government entities and the manufacturing of various nano-concrete products such as manhole covers and frames (according to BS-EN124 code), line markers, truss profiles and more. At first I started as a researcher and participitated in a few studies with the main purpose of understanding the root of problem and providing a systematic approach to solve it. Projects that I contributed in are as follow:
(1) “Investigating the risk of land subsidence of plains in Zanjan and Qazvin provinces on high voltage transmission lines using satellite imagery and spatial information systems and offer corrective solutions” for Zanjan Regional Electric Company.
(2) “Methods to remove roots and prevent root intrusion in branch connections of sewage and water pipes” for Water and Sewage Company of Mashhad.
(3) “Seismic Vulnerability Assessment (Case Study) and Risk Evaluation of Electrical Substations” for Azerbaijan Regional Electricity Company.
(4) “Investigating the feasibility of reactive powder concrete in manhole cover manufacturing” for Water and Sewage Company of Eastern Azarbaijan.
After a year I was promoted to R & D manager where I handled the (1) design and render of new products, (2) performing finite element analysis (FEM) to optimize product properties, (3) testing new combination of materials to accomplish the best quality material, (4) enhancing manufactoring process by desiging tools necessary to increase productivity.

My background and history
======
I recieved my bachelor's degree from Urmia Univesity majoring in civil engineering, my master's degree from University of Tabriz majoringin water resources engineering. My research experience started out during my master's degree in conducting my thesis with consultation of distinguished professor Vahid Nourani about "Spatio-temporal Disaggregation of Rainfall using Rain-gauge and Radar Derived Data". Main hypothesis of my thesis was scale-invariant nature of rainfall in temporal and spatial domain which was investigated via wavelet transform, soft computing techniques and stochastic processes.
